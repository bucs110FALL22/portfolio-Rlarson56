# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
This program allows the user to open a fortune cookie. Inside will be a random slip of advice from the AdviceAPI!
## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
I can't control when the advice is so long that the text spans off the paper.
## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*
None
## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*
DISCLAIMER: I didn't write any of the slips. If one of the slips (for some reason) says something distasteful, I couldn't have known.
